# Modular arithmetic

- Modulus: q > 2   
- a=b (mod q ) means that a–b is an integer multiple of q.   
- r=a mod q means that r is the remainder upon dividing the integer a by q (so 0 ≤ r ≤ q-1).    
- Integers modulo q: $$Z_q = {0,1,2,..., q - 1}$$, where addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo q.    
- Example: $$ Z_{17} = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1 1,12, 13, 14, 15, 16}$$. 
    - In $$ Z_{17}$$, 9+ 15 =7, 9-15 = 11, and 9x 15 = 16. 
    - More precisely, 9 + 15 = 24 =7 (mod 17), 9-15 = -6 =11 (mod 17), and 9 x 15 = 135 = 16 (mod 17).

# Polynomial rings

- Let q be a prime modulus. 
- $$Z_q[x]$$ is the set of all polynomials in x with coefficients in $$Z_q$$ 

- When adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing polynomials in $$Z_q[x]$$, all coefficient arithmetic is performed in $$Z_q$$ 

- Example: Let q =7, and consider $$ f(x) = 5 + 4x^2+ 3x^3$$ ∈ $$Z_7[x]$$ and $$g(x) =6+ 3x + 2x^2$$ ∈ $$Z_7[x]$$. Then:  
    - $$ f(x)+g(x)= 4+3x + 6x^2+3x^3$$.
      
    - $$ f(x)-g(x) = 6+ 4x + 2x^2 +3x^3$$.
       
    - $$ f(x)*g(x) = 2 +x+6x^2+ 2x^3 + 3x^4+6x^5 $$    

# The polynomial ring $$R_q = ℤ_q[x]/(x^n + 1)$$
✦ Let q be a prime modulus, and let n be a positive integer.
✦ The polynomial ring $$R_q = ℤ_q[x]/(x^n + 1)$$ is comprised of the polynomials in of $$ℤ_q[x]$$ degree less than n , with multiplication of polynomials performed modulo the reduction polynomial $$x^n+1$$.

✦ So, to multiply polynomials f(x),g(x) ∈ $$R_q$$:  

- i. Multiply f(x) and g(x) in $$ℤ_q[x]$$ obtaining a polynomial h(x) of degree at most 2n-2.  

- ii. Divide h(x) by  $$x^n + 1$$to get a remainder polynomial of degree at most n-1.  

- iii. Then $$f(x)×g(x) = r(x) $$ in $$R_q$$

✦ Note: The size of $$R_q$$ is $$q^n$$
