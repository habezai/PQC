# Modular arithmetic

- Modulus: q > 2   
- a=b (mod q ) means that a–b is an integer multiple of q.   
- r=a mod q means that r is the remainder upon dividing the integer a by q (so 0 ≤ r ≤ q-1).    
- Integers modulo q: $$Z_q = {0,1,2,..., q - 1}$$, where addition, subtraction and multiplication are performed modulo q.    
- Example: $$ Z_{17} = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1 1,12, 13, 14, 15, 16}$$. 
    - In $$ Z_{17}$$, 9+ 15 =7, 9-15 = 11, and 9x 15 = 16. 
    - More precisely, 9 + 15 = 24 =7 (mod 17), 9-15 = -6 =11 (mod 17), and 9 x 15 = 135 = 16 (mod 17).

# Polynomial rings

- Let q be a prime modulus. 
- $$Z_q[x]$$ is the set of all polynomials in x with coefficients in $$Z_q$$ 

- When adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing polynomials in $$Z_q[x]$$, all coefficient arithmetic is performed in $$Z_q$$ 

- Example: Let q =7, and consider $$ f(x) = 5 + 4x^2+ 3x^3$$ ∈ $$Z_7[x]$$ and $$g(x) =6+ 3x + 2x^2$$ ∈ $$Z_7[x]$$. Then:  
    - $$ f(x)+g(x)= 4+3x + 6x^2+3x^3$$.
      
    - $$ f(x)-g(x) = 6+ 4x + 2x^2 +3x^3$$.
       
    - $$ f(x)*g(x) = 2 +x+6x^2+ 2x^3 + 3x^4+6x^5 $$    

# The polynomial ring $$R_q = ℤ_q[x]/(x^n + 1)$$
✦ Let q be a prime modulus, and let n be a positive integer.
✦ The polynomial ring $$R_q = ℤ_q[x]/(x^n + 1)$$ is comprised of the polynomials in of $$ℤ_q[x]$$ degree less than n , with multiplication of polynomials performed modulo the reduction polynomial $$x^n+1$$.

✦ So, to multiply polynomials f(x),g(x) ∈ $$R_q$$:  

- i. Multiply $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$ in $$ℤ_q[x]$$ obtaining a polynomial $$h(x)$$ of degree at most 2n-2.  

- ii. Divide $$h(x)$$ by  $$x^n + 1$$to get a remainder polynomial of degree at most n-1.  

- iii. Then $$f(x)×g(x) = r(x) $$ in $$R_q$$

✦ Note: The size of $$R_q$$ is $$q^n$$

# Example: The polynomial ring $$R_q = ℤ_{41}[x]/(x^4 + 1) $$
Let  $$ q = 41 $$ and $$ n = 4 $$ . 

✦ Then $$ R_q $$ is comprised of the polynomials in $$ℤ_{41}[x] $$ of degree at most 3.

✦ Let $$ f(x) = 32 + 17x^2 + 22x^3 ∈ R_q $$ and $$ g(x) = 11 + 7x + 19x^2 + x^3 ∈ R_q$$ .

✦ In $$ℤ_{q}[x] $$,
$$ h(x) = f(x) × g(x) = 24 + 19x + 16x^2 + 24x^3 + 26x^4 + 25x^5 + 22x^6$$

✦ The division of $$ h(x) $$ by $$ x^4+1 $$ can be accomplished by replacing $$ x^4 $$ by $$ -1 $$ , $$ x^5 $$ by $$ -x $$, and $$ x^6 $$ by $$ -x^2 $$, and then simplifying.

✦ We obtain $$r(x) = 24 + 19x + 16x^2 + 24x^3 − 26 − 25x − 22x^2 $$    
=  $$ 39 + 35x +  35x^2 + 24x^3 $$

✦ So, $$ f(x) × g(x) = r(x) = 39 + 35x + 35x^2 + 24x^3 $$ in  $$ R_q $$.

# Representing polynomials as vectors
✦ A polynomial $$ f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + ⋯ + a_{n−1}x^{n−1} $$ in  $$ R_q = ℤ_q[x]/(x^n + 1) $$ can be represented by its vector of coefficients $$ f = (a_0, a_1, …, a_{n−1}) $$
The vector has length exactly $$n$$ .

✦ Example: Consider $$R_q = ℤ_{41}[x]/(x^4 + 1) . $$

- ✦ The polynomials $$f(x) = 23 + 11x^2 + 7x^3 ∈ Rq$$ and $$ g(x) = 40 + 5x + 16x^2 ∈ R_q $$ can be represented by the vectors $$ f = (23, 0, 11, 7)$$  and $$ g = (40, 5, 16, 0)$$  .

- ✦ In $$R_q$$ , we have  f+g  = (22,5,27,7), f − g = (24, 36, 36, 7), and f × g = (12, 3, 29, 7)
